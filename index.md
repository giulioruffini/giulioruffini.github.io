I am a theoretical physicist and computational neuroscientist researching consciousness through the lens of algorithmic information theory. My work involves creating advanced biophysical models to understand brain dynamics and structured experience, and translating these insights into clinical applications—particularly in the field of noninvasive brain stimulation, where computational neuropsychiatry and computational neurophenomenology will play a key role. I’m especially interested in how these models illuminate human experience and their broader implications for artificial intelligence and other life forms.
