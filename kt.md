# History of Kolmogorov Theory (KT) Papers

1. **2007 – Information, Complexity, Brains, and Reality (Kolmogorov Manifesto)**  
   Introduces Kolmogorov complexity as a foundation for cognition and models “reality” as compressed abstractions.  
   [arXiv:0704.1147](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1147)

2. **2009 – Reality as Simplicity**  
   Explores simplicity and algorithmic compression in cognitive science, proposing that all experience is a mental construct based on data compression.  
   [arXiv:0903.1193](https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1193)

3. **2016 – Models, Networks, and Algorithmic Complexity**  
   Demonstrates the equivalence of models, classification functions, invariances, and datasets under algorithmic complexity; shows how neural networks implement such models.  
   [arXiv:1612.05627](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05627)

4. **2017 – An Algorithmic Information Theory of Consciousness**  
   Formalizes a framework to quantify structured experience via neurophysiological data and compressive models.  
   [Neuroscience of Consciousness](https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2017/1/nix019/4470874)

5. **2021 – The 2D Ising Model, Criticality, and AIT**  
   Links critical phenomena in the 2D Ising model with measures of algorithmic complexity, with applications in computational neuroscience.  
   [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.21.465265v1)

6. **2022 – AIT Foundations of Structured Experience**  
   Presents a unifying AIT-based framework for studying the structure of conscious experience.  
   [Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S2705078522500047)

7. **2022 – Algorithmic Structure of Experience and the Unfolding Argument**  
   Examines challenges to AIT-based theories of consciousness posed by the “unfolding argument.”  
   [PsyArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/7nbsw) (preprint v1: [k3q6r_v1](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/k3q6r_v1))

8. **2023 – LSD‑Induced Increase of Ising Temperature and Algorithmic Complexity of Brain Dynamics**  
   Shows that LSD shifts brain dynamics away from criticality, increasing complexity in fMRI‑derived Ising models.  
   [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010811)

9. **2024 – Neural Geometrodynamics, Complexity, and Plasticity: A Psychedelics Perspective**  
   Integrates dynamics, complexity, and plasticity to explain how psychedelics alter neural landscapes.  
   [Entropy 26(1):90](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/26/1/90)

10. **2025 – Structured Dynamics in the Algorithmic Agent**  
    Analyzes how symmetry and compressive models shape an agent’s structural and dynamical repertoire.  
    [Entropy 27(1):90](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/27/1/90)

11. **(In Prep) – Navigating Complexity: How Resource‑Limited Agents Derive Probability and Generate Emergence**  
    Demonstrates how limited data access and computational resources give rise to probabilistic reasoning and emergence in KT agents.  
    [Entropy 26(11):953](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/26/11/953)

12. **(In Prep) – The Algorithmic Agent Perspective and Computational Neuropsychiatry: From Etiology to Advanced Therapy in MDD**  
    Applies the KT framework to model Major Depressive Disorder and inform therapeutic strategies.  
    [OSF Preprint](https://osf.io/3xy5d/)
